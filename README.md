# It's Simple UPNP
A simple (yet chonky) UPNP client

Built with javascript, and NW.js (which makes for the chonky part)

Just another one of those tools that allows you to handle port forwarding more easily (as long as your router supports UPNP)

Just fire up the application, see if it supports UPNP or not (tag in the title), and add whatever you want!

You can also remove forwards.
